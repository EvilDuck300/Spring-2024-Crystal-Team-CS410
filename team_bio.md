Hello, my name is Domenic Hankle and I am a Computer Science student here at ODU expected to graduate in the Fall of 2024.
I currently work at an internship that specifically focuses on web app development for video surveillance software, but I
really enjoy learning about graphics programming in OpenGL and the GLSL shading language. Some hobbies of mine include playing soccer and disc golf!

Hi there, I own my own company and attend Odu full-time to get a degree, so I'm actively involved in both entrepreneurship and academia. In addition to my career and academic goals, I enjoy playing basketball, football, and soccer. My goal in this class is to learn how I aim to address the challenges present in business environments by developing a technology-based project.
