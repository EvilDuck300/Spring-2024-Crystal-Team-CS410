Hello, my name is Domenic Hankle and I am a Computer Science student here at ODU expected to graduate in the Fall of 2024.
I currently work at an internship that specifically focuses on web app development for video surveillance software, but I
really enjoy learning about graphics programming in OpenGL and the GLSL shading language. Some hobbies of mine include playing soccer and disc golf!
