Hi there, I own my own company and attend ODU full-time to get a degree, so I'm actively involved in both entrepreneurship and academia.
In addition to my career and academic goals, I enjoy playing basketball, football, and soccer.
My goal in this class is to learn how I aim to address the challenges present in business environments by developing a technology-based project.
