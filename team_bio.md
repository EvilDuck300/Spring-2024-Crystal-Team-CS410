Hi there, I own my own company and attend Odu full-time to get a degree, so I'm actively involved in both entrepreneurship and academia. In addition to my career and academic goals, I enjoy playing basketball, football, and soccer. My goal in this class is to learn how I aim to address the challenges present in business environments by developing a technology-based project.
